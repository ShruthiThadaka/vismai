    <p><strong>Boondi laddu Recipe</strong>- Besan (Gram flour) is made into a loose batter and Boondi is fried to a
        <br>
        golden colour. This Boondi is allowed to soak in one-string thick sugar syrup. The Boondi is <br>then bound into
        laddoos. These Laddoos stay fresh and juicy for more than a week easily.

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>Gram Flour (Besan):</h3>
    <Ol>
        <li>Remember to run the Besan through a fine sieve before using it.</li>
    </Ol>
    <h3> Water:</h3>
    <Ol>
        <li>The batter should be a little thinner than Dosa batter.</li>
    </Ol>
    <h3> How to drop the Boondis into the Kadhai:</h3>
    <Ol>
        <li>Hold the sieve-ladle near to the hot oil</li>

        <li>Pour the batter onto the centre of the sieve â€“ladle and hold still. The Boondi will drop in round <br>
            baubles
            into the hot oil. If we tap the ladle, or rub over the batter on the ladle, the Boondi will <br>not come
            round
            and uniformly. It will look like tailed droplets.</li>
    </Ol>
    <h3>Why does the Boondi come in lumps?</h3>
    <Ol>
        <li>If we over- crowd the Kadhai, and put in more Boondi thatn the Kadhai can hold, tehn the Boondi will <br>
            have no
            space and will stick to the other droplets., forming lumps. Boondi can form lumps if the batter is <br>too
            thick.</li>

    </Ol>
    <h3>Sugar Syrup:</h3>
    <Ol>
        <li>For these Laddoos we require the Besan and Sugar to be taken in the ratio of 3:1. The water <br> should be
            half
            of the measure of Sugar taken.</li>
        <li>As soon as the sugar melts and the Syrup cooks to a one-string consistency, take the Syrup off <br> the
            flame. We
            do not need to cook the syrup any more.</li>
    </Ol>
    <h3>What to do if the Syrup becomes too thick and sticky:</h3>
    <Ol>
        <li>If we take care to stop cooking the syrup beyond the stage of one-string consistency, there will be no <br>
            problem at all. If it does so happen that the Syrup turns thick and you are not able to help the situation,
            <br>
            then add a little water and put it on the flame. As soon as the mixture loosens up, go ahead and bind the
            <br>
            Laddoos.</li>
    </Ol>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <Ul>
        <li>Run the Besan through a fine sieve. Prepare a batter with water, making sure that there <br>are no lumps.
        </li>
        <li>Melt the sugar and prepare Syrup of one-string consistency.</li>

        <li>Heat the oil. Hold the perforated ladle close to the oil and drop the batter into pearl like <br> Boondis

            through the ladle. Follow the tips about how to drop the Boondi into <br>the oil. Fry till golden brown and
            take out
            the Boondis. Do not drop too much of Boondi <br>into the Kadhai at one time.</li>
        <li>As soon as the Boondi is taken out, put it into the Syrup. Dunk it into the Syrup nicely <br> with the help
            of a large
            spoon. Keep adding the rest of the Boondi into the Syrup. Mix <br>well.</li>

            fresh and juicy even after a week. (Do follow the Tips <br>please).</li>
